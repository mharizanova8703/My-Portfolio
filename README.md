# My Portfolio 
 https://mharizanova8703.github.io/My-Portfolio/

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is  Mariya!  I am a future full-stack developer, speciacializing in front-end development.  This portfolio is  based on HTML, and CSS @Media.
I used several CSS properies, including; Transition, @media, ScaleX(), Scroll-Behavior, Pseudo-Elements, Flex-Box, and Justify-Content.  The biggest challange I faced while creating my portfolio was figuring out how to adjust my webpage for mobile and tablet devices. This is an important skill to learn because globally  68.1 % of all website visits in 2021 came from mobile devisces (excluding tablets). Finding the right size images, and elements was quite challenging, but the experience taught me lessons that I can use to implement  my new skills in the future.  My portfolio presents the user with a little more information about myself, my skills and my knowledge of building responsive webpages. 

Specail Thanks to @djdyer helping me to figure  out how to ajust my webpage for a mobile devices.
