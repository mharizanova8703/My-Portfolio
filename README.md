# My Portfolio

Hello! ðŸ‘‹

My name is  Mariya!  I am a future full-stack developer, speciacializing in front-end development.  This portfolio is  based on HTML, and CSS @Media.
I used several CSS properies, including; Transition, @media, ScaleX(), Scroll-Behavior, Pseudo-Elements, Flex-Box, and Justify-Content.  I faced several challenges while creating my portfolio. The first was figuring out how to adjust my webpage for mobile and tablet devices. Finding the right size images, and elements was quite challenging, but the experience taught me lessons that I can use to implement  my new skills in the future.  My portfolio presents the user with a little more information about myself, my skills and my knowledge of building responsive webpages. 

Us we know globally  68.1 % of all website visits in 2021 came from mobile devisces (excluding tablets).<img width="851" alt="Screen Shot 2021-09-07 at 2 28 34 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/85656320/132393688-14a1fb37-09f3-4502-b1ce-4fc0da161e3e.png">
